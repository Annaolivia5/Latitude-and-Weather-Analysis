    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>
        In this project, OpenWeatherMap API is used answer questions about how weather 
        across the globe is affected by distance from the equator. Citipy is used to 
        find the nearest city to randomly generated latitudes and longitudes, for 500+ 
        cities across the globe.
    </P>
    <p>
        The following relationships are illustrated, based on the random selection of 
        cities:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Each of the following for both northern and southern hemispheres:
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
                <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
                <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
                <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Also in this project, Google Places API is used to generate a heat map of humidity 
        in the random selection of cities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, from the random selection of cities, only the cities that meet certain 
        requirements (listed below) are located with markers on a map, using gmaps, 
        along with the name of the nearest hotel name.
        Requirements:
        Maximum low temp= 72F
        Maximum high temp = 79F
        Maximum wind speed = 10 MPH
        Maximum cloudiness = 0%
    </p>
